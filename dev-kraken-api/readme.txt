== Upgrade Notice ==
While security is a major reason to upgrade software and can\'t be overstated, there are some cool benefits to software updates. Often you\'ll see improved functionality and increased ease of use.

Since the user is the center of the developer\'s universe, they want to make your experience better with every release. You\'ll find user experience and user interaction will improve with most new software releases.

When you upgrade, you\'ll likely receive a prompt telling you all about the new release. Next time you update, read through the information provided by the software company. You might find that there are some cool new and improved features that either you didn\'t expect or solve a problem you didn\'t realize could be fixed.

There is a lot to enjoy when a great developer releases a new version of just about any software.
